## 📚 Topics Covered

### 🔁 1. Comprehensions
One-liners that pack a punch. Master the art of writing compact, readable Python using:
- List Comprehensions
- Dictionary Comprehensions

- Context managers (`with open(...) as file`)
- Handling large files efficiently
- File operations: renaming, deleting

> 📝 _Data written well is data remembered._

### 🧩 4. Pattern Problems
The holy grail of logic. Nail interviews and logical reasoning with:
- Pyramid patterns
- Number & alphabet triangles
- Hollow shapes
- Inverted, diamond, and Pascal patterns
